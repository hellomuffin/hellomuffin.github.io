    <h1>Biography</h1>
    <p>
      Xiuming Zhang is currently a Senior Machine Learning Scientist at Tesla Autopilot, working on 3D computer vision,
      neural rendering, and NeRF. Before Tesla, he worked on computational photography at Adobe Emerging Products Group.
      In August 2016, Xiuming
      earned his Ph.D. (CS) in computer vision and computer graphics with Prof. William T. Freeman at the Computer
      Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). During
      MIT, he also received mentorship from Dr. Jonathan T. Barron via internships at Google Research. Xiuming's
      doctoral
      dissertation <i>Shape, Reflectance, and Illumination From Appearance</i> studies inverse rendering and its
      applications, including 3D shape reconstruction and free-viewpoint relighting. He received his S.M. (CS) from MIT
      in
      2018 and B.Eng. (EE) from
      the National University of Singapore (NUS) in 2015, with Lee Kuan Yew Gold Medal. At NUS, his bachelor's thesis
      was advised by Prof. B. T. Thomas Yeo on Bayesian modeling of brain disorder heterogeneity. Besides Tesla, Adobe,
      Google, MIT, and NUS, Xiuming has also spent time in the research labs of the Institute for Infocomm Research,
      Singapore, and the University of Waterloo, Canada. Recognized by a Snap Research Fellowship in 2019, his research
      has been placed on exhibition in the MIT Museum and covered by various popular press outlets, including BBC,
      Forbes, Yahoo!, and Popular Mechanics.
